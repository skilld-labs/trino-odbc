5. Click `Test` to verify connectivity; you will get a `Connection succeeded` message if your configuration is correct.
6. Click `OK` to save the DSN values. 

## Notes

- When `Identitiy Provider: Azure AD` or `Identitiy Provider: Okta` are in the `Auth Type` field, the access key ID, secret access key and session token fields will be hidden as they are not needed.

- Balloons would appear as tips when wrong input is entered for selected field. Clicking out of the field would cause the balloon to temporarily disappear.
