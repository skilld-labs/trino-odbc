## Publish Report

* Create a report using Power BI Desktop. The Power BI Gateway cannot access the `.aws` folder so the report should be created using IAM authentication.

* Click on **Publish** to publish the report on Power BI service.

* Select a destination and click `Select`. You will get a success message when report is published.

* Click on `Open '<report name>' in Power BI` to open published report in Power BI service.

**Notes:**

If you are using multi-factor authentication, you will need to update the token in Power BI Desktop and re-publish any reports. You will also need to delete and re-add the data source with the new token in Power BI Gateway.

To update the token:

1. Go to `Transform Data` page. 
    1. If you have not connected to Power BI Desktop, connect on Power BI Desktop using connector and select `Transform Data` on the `Navigator` page.
